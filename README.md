# NewsDepot

NewsDepot is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. By using Mongoose and Cheerio we are able to scrape and store articles into a database. None of the articles are hard coded or actaully written just pull fromn the db.

Currently the app cannot function when uplaoded to Heroku due to the amount of data in the database, but if downloaded it works prefectly fine on your local host.
